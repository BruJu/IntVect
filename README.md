# IntVect or W/E name I gave to the repo

In this repo we try to study the performance of simple sorted vector / btreemap
in Rust and in Wasm (wasm_bindgen / wasm-pack exported code).

**Files**

- `intvect.rs` is the code that contains the data structures

- `main.rs` is the code used to benchmark in Rust native
- `intvect.js` is the code used to benchmark in Javascript with nodejs

- `intvectdataloop_.csv` is the benchmarked time on my computed (processor i5
with 16 GB of RAM (*TODO : have more precise data spec*))
- `IntBook.ipynb` is the exploration of the data



*TODO : study on more complex datastructures ?*
- *vec and tree of strings ?*
- *arrays ?*
- *explore memory ?*
